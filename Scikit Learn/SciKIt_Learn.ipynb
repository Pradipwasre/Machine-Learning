        "If you’re learning Python and would like to develop a machine learning model then a library that you want to seriously consider is scikit-learn. Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn) is a machine learning library used in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.\n",

        "In this simple guide, we’re going to create a machine learning model that will predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. This is known as binary text classification and will help us explore the scikit-learn library while building a basic machine learning model from scratch. These are the topics we’re going to learn in this guide.\n",
