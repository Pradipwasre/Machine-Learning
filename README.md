# Machine-Learning
Practcing all of my Machine learning skills

# 6 steps
## 1. Problme defination:

"what problem we are going to solve 

## 2. Data:

Data is requirement for any Machine Learning project. what kind of data you have? Depending on the problem, there are different kinds of data such as rows and columns 

* Structured data: Such as rows and columns, or waht you'd expect to find in an Excel spreadsheet
* Unstructured data such as images and audio
- Once we know what kind of data we have, we can start to make decisions on how to use machine learning with it 

## 3. Evaluation:

Here "What defiens success for us?"
* Since Machine Leanring actually is experimantal. You can keep going forever trying to improve your results in search of the perfect model.

* As a practitioners, we know the prefect model doesn't exist. We began by saying, for the machine learning real estate project to be feafible, we need atlest a 95% accurate model at predicting the cost of houses.

## 4. Features

What do we already know about the data? 

* For example: for predicting whether or not someone has heart disease, you might use their body weight as a featureSince body weight is a number, it's called a numerical feature.

* After talking to a doctor, they might tell you if someone's body weight is over a certain number, they're more likely to have heart disease.

* They are more kinds of features, such as categorical and derived.

## 5. Modelling:

Once you've learned a little bit about your data, the next step is to model it.
"Based on out problem and data, what model should we use?"

* Unlike other algorithms and sets of instructions, you have to write from scratch, Many of algorithms are already coded for you, which is beautiful for us.

* Some models work better on different problems than others, and in the beginning your focus will be to figure out the right model for the right kind of problem.

## 6. Experimentation:

"How could we improve/what can we try next?"

All of the steps we've just been through happen in cycle. How might start out with one problem defination and find your data isn't suited to it. Then you might build a model and find out it doesn't work as well as you outlined in yout evaluation metric.

# Types of MACHINE LEARNING problem:

### 1. Problme Defination: "what problem we trying to solve?"

<sub>Supervised Learning </sub>
<sub>Unsupervised Learning </sub>
<sub>Transfer Learning </sub>
<sub>Reinforcement Learning </sub>

### **Supervised Learning:** 

Supervised learning is called supervised learning because you have data and labels. A machine learning algorithm tries to use the data to predict a label. If it guesses the label wrong, the algorithms corrects itself and tries again. This act of correction is why it's called `supervised`. It's like if you were trying to guess the steps it took to turn a set of ingredients, the data into your favourite soup dish, the label. If you tried once and got it wrong, you tell yourself this was wrong. Maybe next time we'll try something different.

_A supervised learing algorithm repeats this process over and over and over again, trying to get better._

* The main types of `supervised learning` problems are classification and regression: 
**Binary Classification:** Two Options. _the person have heart disease: yes or no_
**Multi-class classification:** The options more than two. Weather prediction: `cloudy, sunny, rainy`
**Regression**: Regression problems involve trying to predict a number. `House predictions`, `stock prices`



### **Unsupervised Learning:**

Unsipervised learning has data but no labels
### **Transfer Learning:**


### **Reinforcement Learning:**
