Practcing all of my Machine learning skills

### 6 steps
1. Problme defination:
"what problem we are going to solve 

2. Data:
Data is requirement for any Machine Learning project. what kind of data you have? Depending on the problem, there are different kinds of data such as rows and columns 

* Structured data: Such as rows and columns, or waht you'd expect to find in an Excel spreadsheet
* Unstructured data such as images and audio
- Once we know what kind of data we have, we can start to make decisions on how to use machine learning with it
